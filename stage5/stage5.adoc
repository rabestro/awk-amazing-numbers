= Spy numbers

== Description

In this stage, we will add another property that is called a *Spy number*. A number is said to be Spy if the sum of all digits is equal to the product of all digits.

Our program calculates the properties of numbers, and also knows how to process a list of numbers. But what if we want to find numbers that have a certain property? For example, in case we want to find ten Buzz numbers starting from 1000. We need to add a new request feature for this. In addition, add a new property â€” Spy numbers. These numbers hide well, so beware. Your task is to modify the program so that it can search for these numbers.

== Objectives

Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. If a user enters zero, terminate the program;
5. If numbers are not natural, print an error message;
6. If a user inputs an incorrect property, print the error message and the list of available properties;
7. For one number, print the properties of the number;
8. For two numbers, print the list of numbers with their properties;
9. For two numbers and a property, print the list of numbers and their properties filtered by the indicated property;
10. Once a request is processed, continue execution from step 3.
